# AWSM
The *AwesomeWaveSplineMachine* is a software synthesizer that utilizes what I call dynamic *WaveSpline* synthesis. For the nerds, this is basically the interpretation of a set of temporal-ordered unitless time-value pairs as parametrically exponentially interpolated one-dimensional spline that you can manipulate in real-time while playback. 

I wonder if nobody came up with something like this, but I couldn't find anything directly related. I'm curious, let me know if you stumbled upon similar projects. Write me an email to rnd7[at]riseup.net.

A screenshot of the *AwesomeWaveSplineMachine* in action. You can try it yourself, check the link below.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-showcase-small.png "AWSM - Header section")

## Purpose
This is not a production-ready music instrument! Some key features are missing, likely there are some bugs, and you can expect audio clicks and glitches under certain conditions. It's a prototype, a proof of concept and my personal playground. But yes, you can make music with it.

## Try it out. It's free.

The *AwesomeWaveSplineMachine* runs in your Browser. Check out the link below.

The software is only tested on MacOS with Chrome and Firefox. In theory, it's cross platform. It probably won't work with outdated or esoteric browsers. 

It's designed to support touch interaction and should work on some mobile devices. At least I could run it on some Android devices. I haven't had the time to test this extensively, so expect some issues. I recommend using a desktop or laptop.

**Caution:** You can scrap your speakers with this tool. You can literally melt the coil. Use it at your own risk! Make sure that Protection is activated and that the Wave Generator waveform always crosses zero within a reasonable amount of time.

## Concept

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

No sines, squares, triangles or sawtooths. I always liked the idea of manipulating the waveform directly. As mentioned this is not my first approach to this idea. I know it takes more than a fancy oscillator to make a synthesizer fun to play with, but that was the starting point.

I was thinking of something to create microtonal soundscapes, sustained clusters and evil bass sounds. That seems to be a suitable field of application for this form of synthesis.

Expect *AWSM* to work like a polyphonic drone synth. Therefore, although that is configurable, voices are sustained per default. You have to actively kill them.

Every single note that is played can be controlled individually. A Voice is accessible throughout its entire life cycle. The waveform and parameters of each Voice are independently configurable. The principle of having a discrete parametric preset as template for a instrument or a sound is softened. Voices float and evolve.

There is no filter section. For a similar effect you might want to try fiddling with the exponent settings or try moving around the WaveSplineNodes.

Time, amplitude, frequency, duration, wavelength, tempo, note value, measures, all the musical units are the same. That's not true, but these are tightly coupled. To account for this enlightenment WaveSplines are unitless and universal, might be quantized and are optionally bound to a master tempo. There is no distinction between VCO or LFO. The frequency range is just prevented from being zero and exceeding the upper end of the audible spectrum. 

I like the principle of rhythmic sequencing without notes or steps. Similar to some modular synths, simple sequences can be created using a gain WaveSpline. Each voice can alsp be melodically sequenced using a seperate pitch WaveSpline, roughly comparable to what an arpeggiator does.

While I understand the principle of the octave as somehow universal, the common subdivisions seem to be a wise choice, but not without alternatives. Why not try to divide it by five. The virtual keyboard can be configured accordingly. I also already mentioned mircotonality,

## User interface

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

This is a screenshot of default state of the user interface. Basically what you see when you start the application. Naming is random and will vary. The application is quite consistent regarding its user interface, so what you see is almost everything you have to deal with. The user interface elements are grouped into different sections. Except for the header and the keyboard these are labeled on the top left corner. You will find the corresponding section in the table of content.


![alt text](documentation/awsm-default-state.png "AWSM - Default state")


---

## Header section  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

You find some global settings in the header section.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-header-section.png "AWSM - Header section")


### Tempo
Within the `WaveSpline View` section you choose a `Time unit`. All units other than `Frequency` are bound to the global `Tempo` value.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-header-tempo.png "AWSM - Header Tempo")


### Main Out
Global mix output volume value. All Wave Generator outputs are mixed and multiplied with the `Main Out` value.


![alt text](documentation/awsm-header-main-out.png "AWSM - Header Main Out")


### Protection
If active the audio output is muted if no zero crossing occurs within a period of 10 seconds. The indicator will start to blink in this case. As soon as a the audio signal crosses zero again the output is continued. I strongly suggest not disabling this feature, but you can by clicking the toggle. The image shows the toggle in its active state.


![alt text](documentation/awsm-header-protection.png "AWSM - Header Main Out")


### Panic
Releases all voices. `Release` values are still taken into account.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-header-panic.png "AWSM - Header Panic")

---

## WaveSpline section 
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)


Within this section you can modify the waveforms by dragging the `WaveSplineNodes` around on the canvas or using the rotary controllers in the `WaveSplineNode` list.


![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-section.png "AWSM - WaveSpline section")

### WaveSpline canvas
`Click` to select the closest `WaveSplineNode` on the canvas. Drag nodes to modify the waveform. Use `Longpress` to add new nodes at the pointer position. The canvas shows always the `WaveSpline` of the currently selected `Generator` within the active `Voice`.

The currently selected `WaveSplineNode`is highlighted.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-canvas.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Canvas")

Removal of a `WaveSplineNode` is currently only possible by clicking on the remove button in the list view.

### WaveSplineNode list
Just a different view of the `WaveSplineNodes` shown on the canvas. Use this to manually input `WaveSplineNode` values. The entries are sorted according to the position on the canvas.

The currently selected `WaveSplineNode` is highlighted.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-nodes.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Nodes")

### WaveSplineNode
There are two types of `WaveSplineNodes` depending on the type chosen in the WaveSpline Settings section.

If the type of the `WaveSpline` is `Spline` or `Step`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-node.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Node")

When the `WaveSpline` type is `Nodes`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-node-exponential.png "AWSM - Exponential WaveSpline Node")

### Time
The temporal position of the `WaveSplineNode` within the waveform. The same as dragging a node from left to right on the canvas.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-node-time.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Node Time")

### Value
The value of the `WaveSplineNode` within the waveform at the given time. This can either be the amplitude or the pitch and is the same as dragging a node up or down.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-node-value.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Node Value")

### Exponent
Only applies for `WaveSplines` of type `Nodes`. Use it to choose the righthand exponent individually per `WaveSplineNode`. Choose a value of 1 for linear interpolation.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-node-exponent.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Node Exponent")

### Remove
Delete a `WaveSplineNode`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-node-remove.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Node Remove")

---

## Generator section 
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Configure how the `WaveSpline` is interpreted. Always shows the values of the selected `Generator` within the active `Voice`

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-section.png "AWSM - Generator Section")


### WaveSplineSettings
Change `WaveSpline` specific values. Depending on the selected `WaveSpline` type the view differs.

Generator Settings for `WaveSpline` of type `Spline`

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-settings.png "AWSM - Generator Settings")

WaveSpline Settings for `WaveSpline` of type `Nodes` or `Step`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-settings-simple.png "AWSM - Generator Settings Step / Nodes")

### Type
`Click` to open a modal. Choose between three different types of WaveSpline. `Spline` uses exponential interpolation. All nodes share the same exponent value. `Nodes` is basically the same as `Spline` but with individual exponent settings per Node. `Step` does not interpolate between the nodes, useful to create pitch sequences for example, not particular suitable for audio output.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-settings-type.png "AWSM - Generator Settings Type")

The modal that opens up next to the button will look like this. The currently selected type is highlighted.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-settings-type-modal.png "AWSM - Generator Settings Type Modal")


### Exponent
Only applicable for `WaveSplines` of type `Spline`. Sets the exponent used by all nodes of the `WaveSpline`. A value of 1 equals linear Interpolation, a value around 2 is similar to a sine wave. Values lower than 1 produce spikes, higher values tend towards a square wave.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-settings-exponent.png "AWSM - Generator Settings Exponent")

### Phase
Shift the phase of the `WaveSpline`. Useful to carefully align the waveforms of multiple voices.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-settings-phase.png "AWSM - Generator Settings Phase")

### WaveSplineView
`WaveSplines` are unitless, so the view determines the way it is rendered as audio, pitch or gain signal. 

The view when Time Grid value is zero which equals infinity, which means no raster.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-compact.png "AWSM - WaveSpline View")

When using a non zero Time Grid value.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-extended.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Extended")

### Time Unit
The Time Unit changes the input method of the Timing control. You can choose between `Frequency`, `Common`, `Note` and `Measure` depending on your preferences. Note that only `Frequency` is independent from the global `Tempo`, while all other options are bound to it and will be scaled when changing the value.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-time-unit.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Time Unit")

The modal that pops up lets you select the desired value. The current selection is highlighted.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-time-unit-modal.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Time Unit")

### Frequency
Depending on the selected Time Unit the control changes to allow the manual input of a frequency respectively a note values. The keyboard section changes the frequency value of the `Wave` generator within the active `Voice`.

This is the input if the selected Time Unit is `Frequency`. Select a frequency. This is the only value that is not bound to the global `Tempo`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-frequency.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Frequency")


This is the input if the selected Time Unit is `Common`. Choose from common musical rhytm values. Bound to global `Tempo`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-common.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Common")

This is the input if the selected Time Unit is `Note`. Choose a fraction. Bound to global `Tempo`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-note.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Note")

This is the input if the selected Time Unit is `Measures`. Duration in Bars. Bound to global `Tempo`.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-measures.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Measures")

### Time Grid
Quantize time. Define the subdivisions per `WaveSpline` cycle. A value of zero turns of temporal quantization. Primarily to create Pitch sequences. In theory also acts as sample rate converter for audible signals.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-time-grid.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Time Grid")

### Time Offset
Only visible for non zero Time Grids. Use this to shift the quantized `WaveSpline` left and right. Useful to carefully align the pitch waveform of multiple voices.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-time-offset.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Time Offset")

### Value Grid
Quantize value. A value of zero turns of value quantization. Useful if you want pitch steps for example. Acts like a bitrate reducer when applied to a `Wave` Generator. 

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-spline-view-value-grid.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Value Grid")

## Voice section  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The currently selected voice can be configured in this section. You can manage the generators and parametes of the envelope for example.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-section.png "AWSM - WaveSpline Voice Section")

### Wave Generator
`Click` to select the Wave Generator and display the according `WaveSpline`. The Wave Generator cannot be removed.

The Wave Generator is used to generate the audio output. Both Pitch and Gain Generators can be connected to modify its parameters.

Especially if you decide to disable `Protection` be sure that the `WaveSpline` crosses zero and the frequencies are not too low in order to prevent damaging your speakers.

The Wave Generator is selected by default. This is what it looks like in its highlighted state.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-wave-generator.png "AWSM - Wave Generator")

### Pitch Generator
`Click` to select the Pitch Generator. The Pitch generator is optional and not connected per default. The view changes as soon as the Generator is connected.

Primary use is melodic sequencing. Might also be used for frequency modulation.

View when not connected.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-pitch-generator.png "AWSM - Wave Generator")

View when connected.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-pitch-generator-connected.png "AWSM - Wave Generator Connected")

### Pitch Connect
Click to create and connect a new WaveSpline Generator that changes the pitch of the Wave Generator of the selected Voice.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-connect.png "AWSM - Pitch Generator Connect")

### Pitch Disconnect
Only visible when connected. Click to disconnect and remove the Pitch Generator of the selected Voice.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-disconnect.png "AWSM - Pitch Generator Connect")

### Pitch octaves
A multiplier that determines how much octaves the Pitch Generator covers. Negative values reverse the pitch direction.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-pitch-generator-octaves.png "AWSM - Pitch Generator Octaves")

### Gain Generator
Click to select the Gain Generator. The Gain generator is optional and not connected per default. The view changes as soon as the Generator is connected.

Use this to add rhytm or for amplitude modulation purposes.


View when not connected

![alt text](documentation/awsm-gain-generator.png "AWSM - Wave Generator")

View when connected

![alt text](documentation/awsm-gain-generator-connected.png "AWSM - Wave Generator")

### Gain Connect
Click to create and connect a new WaveSpline Generator that affects the amplitude of the Wave Generator within the selected Voice.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-connect.png "AWSM - Pitch Generator Connect")

### Gain Disconnect
Only visible when connected. Click to disconnect and remove the Pitch Generator of the selected Voice.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-generator-disconnect.png "AWSM - Pitch Generator Connect")



### Voice Settings
Configure the envelope and the mix volume of the selected voice.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-settings.png "AWSM - Voice Settings")

### Attack
Attack time. Time it takes to reach the volume when a voice is spawned or revived.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-settings-attack.png "AWSM - Voice Settings Attack")

### Sustain
Sustain Time. Per default the Sustain time is infinite. If you choose a value the voice is automatically killed after the given time. The sustain period starts after the Attack time, or whenever the sustain value is changed.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-settings-sustain.png "AWSM - Voice Settings Sustain")

### Release
The time a voice is faded out after being killed. Also applies when the Panic button is pressed.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-settings-release.png "AWSM - Voice Settings Release")

### Volume
Additonally to the Gain generator and the envelope setting the Volume value is finally multiplied with the Wave Generator output. Use this to change overall Volume per Voice.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-settings-volume.png "AWSM - Voice Settings Volume")

### Spawn
Click this button to spawn a new Voice by cloning the values of the currently selected voice. You want to choose this method, if you do not want to change the configured Wave Generator frequency as it happens when you press a keyboard key.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-spawn.png "AWSM - Voice Spawn")

---

## Voices section 
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

A `Voice` has a life cycle, and within this section you can manage it. The currently selected `Voice` is highlighted. Using the `Keyboard` or by clicking the `Spawn` button you create a clone that immediately appears in this section. Each `Voice` can be modified individually as long as it is played back.

Voices contain the `Wave` generator and optional `Pitch` and `Gain` generators. Select a `Generator` by clicking on it.

Since Voices are sustained by default you might end up with a bunch of voices while playing on the keyboard. Either choose a `Sustain` time, `Kill` Voices manually or click the `Panic` button to get rid of them all.

The `Ether` is the default `Voice` and acts as template to spawn new voices. The `Grave` holds the last `Voice` that died while being selected. Everything you hear is listed right of the grave in the audible voices section.


![alt text](documentation/awsm-voices-section.png "AWSM - Voices")


### Ether
Click to select the `Voice` from the `Ether`. Basically a non audible `Voice` that acts as default template. Select this, if you want to configure a voice before it is played. After configuring you can play the voice using the Keyboard or the Spawn button. 

The `Ether` never changes unintentionally. 

In this graphics is the selected state of the `Ether` as you find it when starting the application.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-ether.png "AWSM - Ether")

### Grave
Similar to the `Ether` the `Voice` in the `Grave` is non audible. Everytime a selected `Voice` is killed and died, either manually or by reaching its `Sustain` time, it ends up in the `Grave`. Use it to respawn a Voice that died.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-grave.png "AWSM - Grave")

### Audible Voices
All voices that are currently active and produce some audio signal are listed here.


### Audible Voice
Click to select the `Voice`. The view changes to display the selected `Voice`. Basically the same as the `Ether` and `Grave` Voices, but currently active and presumably producing some audio output.

Every Voice has an Attack, Hold and Release state.

Audible `Voice` while living

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-active.png "AWSM - Voice Active")

Audible `Voice` when killed

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-killed.png "AWSM - Voice Killed")

### Audible Voice Kill
As soon as you click the kill button the `Voice` is released and the view changes. After the `Release` time the `Voice` is removed from the audible voices section. If it was selected while being removed it will show up in the `Grave`, otherwise it is gone.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-kill.png "AWSM - Voice Kill")

### Audible Voice Revive
During the Release Phase you have the opportunity to Revive a Voice. The Voice state changes to Attack, the voice is faded in again.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-voice-revive.png "AWSM - Voice Revive")


---

## Keyboard section
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-section.png "AWSM - Voice Revive")


### Mode
You might choose from two different Keyboard Modes. `Poly` will spawn a new Voice everytime you press a Keyboard Key. `Mono` will only spawn on Voice but keep setting the Wave Generator frequency of the selected Voice. You might use the `Mono` mode to change the frequency of any Voice selected using the Keyboard.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-mode.png "AWSM - Keyboard Mode")

The following modal pops up when clicking the select button. In this case `Poly` is selected.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-mode-modal.png "AWSM - Keyboard Mode")

### Keyboard
Somehow self explaining, I guess. Depending on the selected Mode a new Voice is spawned using the currently selected as template or, when in `Mono` Mode, the Wave Generator frequency is changed according to the key pressed.

The frequency of the Wave Generator of the currently selected voice is highlighted. In this example c3.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard.png "AWSM - Keyboard")

### Transpose
Shifts the Keyboard range octace wise.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-transpose.png "AWSM - Keyboard Transpose")

### Config
Opens up the Keyboard Config Panel to configure the virtual Keyboard.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-config.png "AWSM - Keyboard Config")

### Keyboard Config Panel
The Keyboard Config Panel opens up when clicking the config button. 


![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-config-modal.png "AWSM - Keyboard Config Modal")

### Keyboard Config Panel Base
Base frequency from which the Key frequencies are calculated from

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-config-base.png "AWSM - Keyboard Config Base")


### Keyboard Config Panel Keys
Amount of keyboard keys to display.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-config-keys.png "AWSM - Keyboard Config Keys")

### Keyboard Config Panel Divisions
Number of subdivisions per octave.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-keyboard-config-divisions.png "AWSM - Keyboard Config Divisions")

---

## Mobile devices
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Mobile device support is limited. I guess it will work on some devices. On small screens the layout changes. Instead of a list of all `WaveSplineNodes` you only see the currently selected `WaveSplineNode` below the canvas. You can scroll through the different sections, the position of the header and the keyboard section stays fixed.

### Landscape
I recommend choosing landscape orientation, since the most important features are better accessible. You can scroll down to view the other sections.

![alt text](documentation/awsm-mobile-landscape.png "AWSM - Mobile device landscape")

### Portrait
While you still can use the application in portrait orientation, I have to admit it does not look beautiful. The header settings are relocated into the `Settings` modal and you probably want to reduce the number of keyboard keys in the `Keyboard Config Panel` to make it easier to use them. 

![alt text](documentation/awsm-mobile-portrait.png "AWSM - Mobile device portrait")


# Developer guide

[Back to top](#awsm)

## Motivation

It was curiosity and the joy in developing software that serves as a tool for creative expression. When I read about the AudioWorklet replacing the ScriptProcessorNode I was excited to try out this new technology. It overcomes the perfomance limitations of the previous approach, perhaps finally sophisticated real-time audio in the browser. I wanted to give it a try. It seemed to be the time for what is now the third revision of a synthesizer, where you can edit the waveform similar to a curve in a vector graphics program.

## Technology

The *AWSM* is raw web technology, a pure vanilla shake, no 3rd party libs used. No dependencies other than a modern browser environment. 

In theory it does not require a build step utilizing a bundler or transpiler. I cried a while when realizing that Firefox currently does not support ES6 module imports within AudioWorklets. It's a shame and I hope this will change some day. For now I had no better idea to resolve and bundle all imports of this component using webpack, the rest of the app stays untouched and is just copied to the dist folder. For development I use Chrome and a dev server that serves directly from the src directory, no need to wait for a build to complete.

Essentially, there are three distinct loosely coupled development realms. The data model and the interpolation logic, the sound generation and the user interface.

The data model is somewhat old-fashioned. It is an event-driven, object-oriented approach with mutable types and cross referencing support. Maybe I'm wrong, but IMAO this seemed appropriate, flexible and performant.

The sound generation is almost exclusively realized using a monolithic AudioWorklet as oscillator. The processing is done using ECMA script only. The performance can certainly be significantly improved if this part is implemented as a WASM module.

The user interface is built exclusively on Web Components technology. All elements are custom made and the components are coupled to the model via an propietary event system.

I like to utilize my free time projects to deepen my knowledge and try out new stuff. Both things that are often hard to justify when working at a regular basis and for a paying customer. Do not consider anything of the code as best practice, as long as you are not convinced it is.

## State of development
This is a protoype, a technology demonstrator, nothing stable.

Nevertheless I put quite a lot of effort into this. Everything was built from scratch. It took me over hundred hours to get this project to where it is today. Uncounted the hours I was lost in creating sounds and music with this tool. 

For now no further development is planned. Even if I'd love to try out some more ideas and integrate a bunch of further features, I do not have the time to do so. Maybe I'll mess around with this some time in the future. Don't expect anything to stay or change.

I think some crucial features are missing. The list is long, but here are a few of the features I would love to add.

- ~~Speaker Protection~~
- ~~Improve support for smartphones and other small screen size devices~~
- Selection and transformation of multiple WaveSplineNodes at once
- Local storage of multiple configurations using IndexedDB API
- WaveSplineProcessor WASM implementation
- Referencing option when connecting generators
- WaveSpline referencing
- Implement more interpolation algorithms
- MIDI support
- Stereo panning for Voices
- Automate everything
- Electron wrapper

## Exponential WaveSpline Algorithm
At its core it's just a simple algorithm. The general concept would also work with linear interpolation, but exponential interpolation sounds so much smoother. Modifying the exponent in realtime changes the curve steepness dynamically somehow similar to what a filter does.

The exponential interpolation algorithm outputs y for x that always stays within the given min / max boundaries of a 2d point set. 

The interpolation curve is calculate by combining two segments of two x to n degree exponetial functions where x > 0.   

This is a simplified example. The curves are actually scaled, moved and limited.

First function 
```
-x^2                       
 
            |                
   -------x-a-a--------     
        x   |   a           
      x     |     a         
     x      |      a         
    x       |       a         
```
Second function
```
x^2

    b       |       x
     b      |      x
      b     |     x
        b   |   x 
   -------b-b-x--------
            | 
```
Combined interpolation curve
```
   a  a
   |     a
   |       a 
   |        a
   |         a
   |          b
   |           b
   |            b
   |              b
   +-----------------b--b 
```

Pseudo code algorithm including transformation
``` 
if x < .5
    f(x) = ((x * 2) ^ e) / 2   
else
    f2(x) = 1 - ((1-x) * 2) ^ e) / 2
```
## Audio Processing
The audio processing is decoupled from the rest of the application. The AudioCore manages the playback and state of all audible Voices. Every voice contains a Wave generator that has a optional pitch and gain input that can be connected to the output of another generator. 

The user interface does not support it, but Generators can be reused by multiple voices. This applies to almost all data model classes. Even WaveSplineNodes could be used in multiple WaveSplines. You always have the choice of just referencing something.

The AudioCore manages the Voices, and the VoiceInterface retrieves all necessary WaveSplineProcessors from a global processor pool. Processors are created on demand and automatically garbage collected using simple reference counting.


## Audio Routing
The *AWSM* produces only a mono output signal the same signal is copied to all channels. The routing is quite straight forward. Note that even if the UI does not allow it, it is possible to use the output of any generator as input parameter for one or more other generators. Pitch and gain generators are optional.
```
pitch generator => wave generator pitch param
gain generator => wave generator gain param
wave generator => ASR / volume
ASR / volume => voice out
voice out => mix
mix => protection
protection => main out
```

## User Interface Component Hierarchy
The user interface largely consists of WebComponents. Abstract, simpler units are called elements, more complex, application-specific ones are reffered to as components.

The component structure of the user interface.

```
